				<h3>Why We Joined the Llama 3 Hackathon</h3><br>

				<p>
					Our team, proudly nerdy and ever-ready to embrace a challenge, dove into the Llama 3 hackathon by
					Meta and Together.ai with gusto. We were driven by a thirst for new skills and a desire to tackle
					something outside our usual comfort zone. None of us had ever wrangled with Together.ai, built a
					Chrome extension, or faced the exhilarating pressure of a 48-hour deadline. Little did we know, due
					to some unforeseen calamities, we’d end up with less than 24 hours. Nothing like a little chaos to
					spice up a hackathon, right?
				</p>

				<h3>How We Created Review Sensai</h3><br>
				<p>
					With the clock ticking, we divided our tasks based on our superpowers: I took on project management
					with an agile and test-driven approach, Dani A. became our API whisperer, and Aiman M. wielded AI
					like a pro. Our project, Review SensAI, is an AI sentiment analysis extension designed to read
					through product reviews and determine if a product is worth buying. It analyzes all available
					reviews, assigns a score out of 100, and highlights notable mentions that frequently appear.
				</p>

				<p>
					We used	TypeScript, React, Vite, and Together.ai to bring this vision to life—because what’s a hackathon
					without a few buzzwords? Despite our best efforts, a time crunch and AI credit shortages meant we
					couldn’t integrate our AI model fully. Instead, we hardcoded an example into our extension, proving
					that even under duress, we could still deliver something cool. Challenges? Oh, we had plenty, but we
					managed to turn chaos into a functional prototype as you can see above. Check out my GitHub
					repository below for more details on our development journey.

				<h3>The Outcome and Impact</h3><br>

				<p>
					In the end, despite having only half the time we’d originally planned, we were over the moon with
					Review Sensai. We may not have nailed the AI model integration, but our hardcoded example was enough
					to show off our concept's potential. The judges and participants were impressed, and we got some
					solid positive feedback. Looking ahead, if we decide to give this project another whirl, we’re
					planning to add features that provide businesses with insights, not just make online shoppers’ lives
					easier. After all, if you’re going to go through a hackathon’s rollercoaster, you might as well come
					out with something that can truly make a difference! You can also check out our presentation below
					to see how we pitched our project at the end of the hackathon.
