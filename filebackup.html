                <p>
                    I have been meaning to strengthen my foundational Powershell and scripting skills for a while now
                    and recently as I was trying to find a way to store my projects folder locally, I decided to use
                    this as an opportunity for a new portfolio project.
                    My goal was to backup a folder stored in my desktop locally, and to add an extra challenge I decided
                    to compress the folder since it would also save some space and set a time for recurring backups.
                </p>

                            <p><strong>1.</strong> I started off by creating a new folder named "Powershell Backup" to
                                store all the files, and opened the folder in VS Code. Within it, I created two
                                additional files, "FileBackup.ps1" which is a scripting file and "Directories.txt" to
                                use for storing text, however it can also be changed to a CSV file to be used with rows
                                and columns in the future.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>2.</strong> Now in the Directories.txt file, I will paste the directory where all
                                my projects are stored that I want to backup and compress. I can also add additional
                                directories, however for now I only need this specific one.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>3.</strong> In the FileBackup.ps1 file, I will first declare a variable to store
                                the directory location from our Directories.txt file. Then declare a second variable
                                that reads the content of the file and stores it in a variable. In this scenario,
                                $BackupLocations is the variable that will hold the content read from the file,
                                Get-Content reads the content of the file, -Path specifies the path to the file whose
                                content we will be reading, and $BackupLocationsFilePath is the variable that holds the
                                path to the file we want to read.</p>

                            <p><strong>4.</strong> Now create a second user.I will now declare two more variables: first
                                one to store the directory of the new backup location, and second one to store the
                                backup name and name format including the time it was created.

                            <p><strong>5.</strong> Since there is a possibility I might be adding additional
                                directories, I want to future proof my code to run the script for multiple directories.
                                To do this I will add a foreach() loop which will iterate through all directories. Just
                                to ensure my code is working, I tested it with a write-output and run the code.

                            <p><strong>6.</strong> Next I want to see what files are inside the directory that we are
                                backing-up. To do I will simply use Get-Children in our loop. This will not show the
                                files within the folders, just the first layer of Children. To preserve the directory
                                structure I will also use Containerize and Recurse.

                            <p><strong>7.</strong> To execute the backup, we will start by using an if statement inside
                                our loop. First the command checks if our storage location exists, then the New-Item
                                command creates a new item in the storage location and the -Path and -ItemType Directory
                                specify the new path and that the new item should be a directory.

                            </p>

                            <p><strong>8.</strong> Now when I run the script, as you can see below it creates a new file
                                with a directory structure in my specified storage location.

                                Windows Task Scheduler to set a weekly backup on every Sunday night. To do this I opened
                                Task Scheduler, Create basic task, provide name and description, select the frequency
                                which in my case is every Sunday at 11:59pm, start a program and then select my
                                FileBackup.ps1 file and then finish to complete my full project.
